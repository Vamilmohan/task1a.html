<h1>Importance and Role of Nature</h1>
<h3>The importance of nature is unparalleled. It gives us necessities like food, air, and water. 
We breathe oxygen given by plants, and plants take in the carbon dioxide we breathe out. 
This is a simple example of how nature balances everything.You can understand its importance 
from the fact that poets and writers have written exceptional pieces about mother nature. 
Writers and poets like Rudyard Kipling, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost,
and many more gave us beautiful poems and proses to make us understand the value of nature. 
Their writings compel us to be closer to nature and lead a happy & healthy life. Being closer 
to nature can heal our prolonged illness and make us fit as a horse.
<br>
The services of nature can be categorised as provisional, regulating, and non-material. 
Provisional services are those activities that give direct benefits from nature like food, 
water, medicinal plants, and many more. The regulating services include regulation of natural 
activities like water purification, decomposition, climate regulation, and many more. The 
non-material service includes recreational activities like interaction with nature to explore 
advents of art, music, culture, and more.</h3>

<h1>Significance of nature conservation</h1>
<pre>
    <h3>
The energy sources in nature are not infinite; we are exhausting them with continuous and
careless usage. It has become very important to start acting about conserving nature with 
our best. The increase in industrialisation, urbanisation, and migration is causing a 
shortage of even basic amenities. There is a rapid surge in the greenhouse effect and 
global warming. Activities like deforestation and transportation are causing an increase in pollution.
Dumps from industries, sewage waste, oil spills, and more are a cause of diseases in humans and animals.
The health of mother nature is deteriorating because of our quest for comfortable living.,</h3>
<br>
<h3>Saving nature is the need of the hour. We can do a lot by just switching to sustainable living standards.
Planting more and more trees, keeping the environment clean and green, and boycotting the usage of plastic 
and non-biodegradable products are some activities that can be inculcated in our daily lives to conserve nature.
We should be rationally using clean water and should indulge ourselves in rainwater harvesting. If we want to 
pass a beautiful environment to our future generation, we should be willing to keep it clean in the present.</h3>
